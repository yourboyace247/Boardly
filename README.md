You can drag and drop tasks from one list to another, in my case I added the exercises of "Cable flies" on my "Leg day" list by accident instead of the "Chest day" list.You can drag the task that is in the wrong list and drop it in the correct one.

# :bulb: Technologies this app shows:

1. Advanced DOM Manipulation: Drag & Drop API.
2. Complex management state: Complex data structure.
3. Algorithms & Data Structures: How do you store and update this structure.
4. LocalStorage/IndexedDB: For persistence.
